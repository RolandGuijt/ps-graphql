It doesn't have a lot of the bells and whistles that some of the pricier kayaks have but, I'm not disappointed.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty bare bones aside from some dry storage areas and some bungees. It does have a bungee to hold your paddle on the side. I feel it paddles very easy. It goes exactly where I want it to, I didn't struggle to keep it on course. A stiff wind can knock you off track but it was very sturdy and I feel like it would take a lot to tip it over.
